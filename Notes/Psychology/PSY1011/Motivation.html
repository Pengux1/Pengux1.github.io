                <p>Activation - it activates or energises behaviour</p>

                <p>Motive - Something that brings together all the different reasons for a behvaiour</p>
                
                <p>Motivation is influenced by: physiological factors, emotional factors (Thoughts, expectations that you will succeed), cognitive factors, social factors (Influenced by peers, family friends, what is seen on tv). These factors may simultaneously influence your motivation.</p>

                <h5 class="page-header">Theories of Motivation</h5>
                
                <p class="bold">Instinct Theory</p>
                
                <p> An instinct is an automatic, involuntary, and unlearned behaviour that is consistently triggered by a particular stimuli.</p>
                
                <p>Evolutionary Approach - Where tendencies evolved as they helped with enviromental adaption.</p>
                
                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <p class="bold">Drive Reduction Theory</p>
                
                <p>- Centred around the principle of homeostasis – the tendency for organisms to keep physiological systems at a steady level:</p>
                
                <p>Homeostasis - For particular orggnisms there is an ideal state for them to be operating at.</p>
                
                <p>- An imbalance in homeostasis generates a biological need and the organism experiences a feeling of arousal or a drive, to take action and restore balance.</p>
                
                <p>Physiological needs create drives. Primary drives are biological requirements such as food or water; Secondary Drives are learned requirements such as $$$CashMonay$$$, recognition, status.</p>
                
                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <p class="bold">Arousal Theory</p>
                
                <p>Arousal – level of physiological activation as measured by brain function, heart rate or muscle tension </p>
                
                <p>Yerkes-Dodson Law states that for most people the optimal level of arousal is when it is moderate.</p>
                
                <p>Moderate levels of arousal lead to optimal performance. </p>
                
                <p>-Think of your arousal level regarding taking an exam for this class. If your level is very low, such as boredom and apathy, your performance will likely suffer. Similarly, a very high level, such as extreme anxiety, can be paralyzing and hinder performance.</p>
                
                <p>We are motivated to behave in ways that maintain one’s optimal level of arousal - optimal level of arousal differs between people e.g., an athlete may have a low optimal arousal level and performs best when arousal is low, while another athlete may perform best when arousal level is high </p>
                
                <div class="divider"></div>
                
                <p class="bold">Incentive Theory</p>
                
                <p>The “carrot and stick” approach to motivation – offering rewards to motivate people and elicit desired behaviour from them (i.e., the carrot) and discouraging other behaviours (i.e., the stick).</p>
                
                <p>Carrot - reward, stick - punishment. It means that this model provides both being motivated to get reward, and motivated to avoid punishment.</p>
                
                <p>Enviromental stimuli motivates behaviour: Motivated to get positive incentives (rewards) i.e. bonus, promotions. Motivated to avoid negative incentives (punishments). i.e. Losing your job.</p>
                
                <p class="bold">The Candle Problem</p>
                
                <p>Give someone a candle, some thumbtacks and matches and ask them how to attach it to the wall so the wax doesn't drip on the floor.</p>
                
                <p>It took 5 to 10 minutes for most people. When thumbtacks were taken out of box, usually solved fairly fast.</p>
                
                <p>The group with an incentive only performed better when the thumbtacks were out of thebox at the beginning.</p>
                
                <p>Rewards can narrow our focus. Extrinsic motivation provides external rewards, which narrow the. Rewards for problems that do not have a clear solution often don't work.</p>

                        <p>According to this model of motivation, our main primal motivations are the need to drink water, eat food and procreate – because they are necessary for our survival. </p>

                        <p>These are our <span class="note bold">physiological needs</span> and until met we do not tend to focus on other needs that are higher up the pyramid e.g., people who are extremely hungry are highly motivated to find food - becoming obsessed over where it will come from and how they will obtain it.</p>

                <p>For three months the calroies they were given is halved. Enter starvation state, their thoughts and emotions were recorded.</p>
            
                <p>Food became sole source of motivation and fascination. Began obsessively thinking about food. Other needs were being replaced by thoughts of food.</p>

                <p class="bold">Stomach Signals</p>
                
                <p>The simplistic view is that an empty stomach will causes feelings of hunger. Stomach will contract, signal hunger. When eat, stomach expands, hunger stops.</p>
                
                <p>Contested by people with stomach removed whomst've can still feel hunger</p>

                <p>Short term depends on fullness, long term is driven by hormone levels.</p>
