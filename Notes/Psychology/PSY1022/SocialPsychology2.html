                    <p>Two types of conformity - Public and Private.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Public</strong> occurs when people truly believe that the group is right.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Private</strong> occurs when we are pressured and feel we do not have a choice other than to conform to group norms.</p>

                    <p><strong>Foot-in-the-door technique</strong> - First make a small request, and then move to a bigger one; will only work if the bigger request is consistent with the smaller one.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Door-in-the-face technique</strong> - Start with a big request, and then make a smaller one; will work only if the same person makes the request which is consistent with the initial one.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Low-ball technique</strong> - First make a person agree, and then increase your terms; works due to commitment as at first the person has already said ‘yes’.</p>

                    <p>So an actor is in a room with fake electrodes attached to them. The participant is brought in to a seperate room, and told that they're performing an experiment judging the effects of punishment on learning. They were instructed to give an electric shock every time the actor got a question wrong, and to increase the voltage each time. The actor obviously wasn't being shocked, but they acted as if they were.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the voltage increased, the actor started to plead that the participant stop, and would scream and cry in distress. However, the experimenter would continue to tell them to give the shocks and increase the voltage. About two thirds of particpants continued to increase the voltage until it reached a level which would have killed the actor.</p>
                    
                    <p>This experiment shows that a majority of people would kill someone or otherwise do something horrible if told to do so by an authority figure.</p>

                    <p><strong>Sex Differences</strong> - Direct vs. Relational (e.g., “the silent treatment”).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Cultural Differences</strong> - Culture of Honour.</p>

                    <h5 class="page-header">Types of Agression</h5>
                    
                    <p><strong>Hostile / Impulsive Aggression</strong> - Violent attitudes or actions, behaviour that cannot be controlled and aimed at hurting others.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Instrumental Aggression</strong> - Aggressive behaviour to achieve a goal, means to a goal.</p>

                    <p>Bla bla bla kids that are fustrated will destroy toys.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="page-header">Excitation Transfer Model</h5>
                    
                    <p>Arousal transfers from one situation to another and promotes the likelihood of aggression. Physiological arousal dissipates slowly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Altruism</strong> - An unselfish concern for another's welfare.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Helping behaviour</strong> - Any act that is intended to benefit another person.</p>

                    <p><strong>Situational Influences</strong> - characteristics of the victim, no easy escape, exposure to helpful role models, mood, being in a hurry.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Enlightenment Effect</strong> - public knowledge about psychological research can change the world.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="page-header">Cost-Reward Theory</h5>
                    
                    <p>Helping reduces the unpleasant arousal felt when confronted with suffering.</p>
                    
                    <p>3 stages: arousal, labelling, evaluation of outcomes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Evaluate the consequences of helping/not helping.</p>
                    
                    <p> Chooses the action with lowest costs = reduces personal distress.</p>
                    
                    <p>Empathy costs (feeling of stress – not helping).</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Personal Costs</strong> - Blame, and even penance when it is legally clear that a bystander failed to do his or her civic duty - when there are a lot of other bystanders, these last costs are less and therefore there are fewer reasons to help.</p>
                    
                    <h5 class="page-header">Bystander Effect</h5>
                    
                    <p><strong>Diffusion of Responsibility</strong> - The presence of others make each person feel less responsible for the outcomes.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pluralistic Ignorance</strong> - Assuming that no one in the group perceives things as we do.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Social Loafing</strong> - People working in groups feel less responsible for the outcomes of a project than they do when working alone.</p>
