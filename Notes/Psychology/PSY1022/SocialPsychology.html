                <p>Social Psychology is defined as the discipline that uses scientific methods "to understand and explain how the thought, feeling and behavior of individuals are influenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence of other human beings."</p>
                
                <p>Brains are predisposed to forming intimate personal networks.</p>
                
                <p>About 150 close relationships is the typical limit.</p>
                
                <p>Humans have a biological need for interpersonal bonds, so much so that depriving an infant of social contact will severely impair its development.</p>
                
                <p>For most people, lack of social contact can lead to mental health issues, including but not limited to: Depression, Anxiety, Addiction and more. So basically:</p>

                <p>Belonging and being socially accepted are fundamental for human beings.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Social Facilitation</h4>
                
                <p>Social Facilitation is defined as:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Enhancement of performance brought about by the presence of others (occurs only with easy tasks).</strong></p>
                
                <p>Social Disruption is basically the opposite of Social Facilitation, defined as:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Worsening of behaviour in front of otherse (Occurs with Difficult Tasks).</strong></p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Social Comparison Theory</h4>
                
                <p>In life, we try to compare ourselves to others. This is done in two ways according to this theory:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Upward</strong> - We compare ourselves to people superior to us.</p>
                
                <p>Highly motivated people: upward communication?</p>
                
                <p><strong>Downward</strong> - We compare ourselves to people inferior to us.</p>
                
                <p>Active is comparing with someone worse off, Passive is demeaning others, causing harm.</p>
                
                <p class="note">This is given with no context, I'll try to properly put it down later.</p>

                <p>A psychological tendency that is expressed by evaluating a particular entity with some degree of favour or disfavour.</p>
                
                <p>Yo, they have three components, ABC - Affective (Emoitions), Behavioural and Cognition.</p>
                
                <p>Bla bla bla your attitudes can have genetic issues but they basically come from social learning and your personality.</p>
                
                <p>Then there's the Recognition Heuristic where the goal is to make inferences about a criterion that is not directly accessible to the decision maker, based on recognition retrieved from memory. So we draw attitudes from past experience.</p>

                <h4 class="page-header">Cognitive Dissonance Theory</h4>
                
                <p>We have an inner drive to hold all our attitudes and beliefs in harmony and avoid disharmony (or dissonance). If there are inconsistencies, we try to rationalise them to reduce psychological discomfort.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Self Perception Theory</h4>
                
                <p>When people are unsure about their feelings and motivations, they will use their own behaviour to infer what they feel.</p>
                
                <p>We sometimes use our own behaviour to guess about what we are feeling. Happens when: Our initial feelings are unclear.</p>

                <h4 class="page-header">Attributions</h4>
            
                <p>Attributions are your attempt at understanding your experiences, behaviours, and the behaviour of others.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Internal Attribution</strong> is behaviour explained due to personal factors like traits, attitudes, feelings, etc.</p>
                
                <p><strong>External Attribution</strong> is behaviour explained due to situational factors.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">The Fundamental Attribution Error</h4>
                
                <p>This is defined as: The tendency to overestimate the the contribution of lasting traits and dispositions in determining people's behavior, as compared to situational effects. We might see someone kicking a vending machine, and conclude they're an inherently angry person. But maybe they just failed a test, had their driving license revoked, and had the machine eat their money for the third time this week. We think of the other person as an evil mutant and ourselves as righteous actors.</p>
                
                <p>Basically, we assume other peoples actions are because of their personality rather than because of their personal situation.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header">Actor-Observer Effect</h4>
                
                <p>A tendency to attribute one's own actions to external causes while attributing other people's behaviors to internal causes. It is a type of attributional bias that plays a role in how we perceive and interact with other people.</p>

                <p><strong>Motivational Theories</strong> - Motivational Theories - Authoritarianism personality trait. Acceptance of traditional values, blindly follow orders from authority, be prejudiced against others who are different.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Cognitive Theories</strong> - The way in which people deal with the world - use of schemas - helps us draw proper conclusions about people, but can sometimes be wrong.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Learning Theories</strong> - Prejudice is learned through conflicts, observing, listening to others, biopreparedness - natural fear of strangers who are different to us.</p>
