                            <p>Benzene is an important organic chemical compound with the chemical formula C₆H₆. The benzene molecule is composed of six carbon atoms joined in a ring with one hydrogen atom attached to each. As it contains only carbon and hydrogen atoms, benzene is classed as a hydrocarbon. Its structure can be seen to the left.</p>

                    <p>Benzene has 6 sp<sup>2</sup> hybridised carbon atoms forming a perfect hexagon with C-C-C and C-C-H bond angles of 120°. This shape allows carbon atoms to share electrons, making them <strong>delocalised</strong>. As a general rule, the more spread out or <strong>delocalised</strong> electrons are in a molecule, the more stable it becomes. By sharing electrons, all the carbon atoms in a benzene ring get 6 stable double bonds and 8 electrons in their outer shell.</p>
                    
                    <p>The six π bonds are delocalised and can move freely about the six carbon nuclei (π cloud), stabilising the bezene molecule.</p>

                    <p>So regular benzene rings are finna symmetric, so they only show as one peak on an NMR spectrum. However when we substitute one of the hydrogen atoms, we reduce the symmertry of the molecule, changing the number of signals. There's not really much else to say, just that the number lines on an 12C NMR spectrum indicate how many carbon enviroments are in a molecule, which can be changed by adding a functional group to a carbon, or the carbon next to it.</p>

                            <p>Aniline is an aromatic compound with an amine group directly attached to the aromatic ring. Aniline is a colourless, oily liquid that is slightly soluble in water.  It is a weak base as resonance "spreads" the electron density.</p>

                    <p>The oxygen lone-pair electrons in neutral phenol can also push electron density into the aromatic ring, although to a lesser degree than in the phenoxide anion. This increases the electron density at the ortho and para positions of the ring, making these carbons more nucleophilic than the meta position. This effect can be seen in the bromination reaction of phenol. Unlike we saw previously with benzene, phenol reacts with bromine rapidly without a catalyst, due to the increased electron density in the ring.</p>

                                <p>The pKa of phenol is almost 6 units lower than that of ethanol, meaning that there is ~10<sup>6</sup> times more phenoxide anion in an aqueous solution of phenol than there is ethoxide ion in a solution of ethanol.

                                <p>As with phenol, the lone pair electrons on the nitrogen of aniline can donate into the aromatic ring. This resonance stabilisation reduces the nucleophilicity of the lone-pair electrons on the nitrogen, which make it a weaker bases. Resonance stabilisation also increases electron density at the ortho and para positions of aniline. The aniline (aminobenzene) aromatic primary amine behaves as a very weak base. Aromatic amines are weaker bases than aliphatic (Not Aromatic) ones due to resonance interaction, which 'spreads' the electron density.</p>

                    <p class="note">oh god it' s reaction mechanisms. I'm going to assume they mean bromination of benzenes, since that's what this topic is about essentially.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Bromination</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Bromination</strong> - Any reaction of process in which bromine (and no other elements) are introduced into a molecule.</p>
                    
                    <p>The bromination of bezene is an electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction. In this reaction, the electrophile (bromine) forms a sigma bond to the benzene ring, yielding an intermediate. Then, a proton is removed from the intermediate to form a substituted benzene ring. The mechanism for this reaction can be seen in the picture below. Also note that Benzene only reacts with Br<sub>2</sub> in the presence of a catalyst.</p>
                    
                    <div class="center">
                    
                        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/BenzeneBromination.png">

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Now to explain this. Bromines are heckin electronegative, and 'hog the electrons' so to speak in the iron bromide molecule, making the iron in the compound slightly positive (With an oxidation number of three). This causes the iron to act as a Lewis Acid, and accept an electron from somewhere else, specifically from the Br<sub>2</sub> molecule, forming a new bond between the iron bromide and the Br<sub>2</sub>. However in the process of donating this electron, the previously neutral bromine now has a positive charge, and the iron a negative charge.</p>
                    
                    <p>So nature is basically like the Avatar, and is always striving for balance, which this new molecule is not. Enter Benzene. Now this positive Bromine is hungry for an electron, and will stop at nothing to get one. But where can he get one from? Simple, he can just steal it from the other bromine next to him, making himself complete. But now this Bromine is hungry for electrons (oh no). Instead of snatching back his electron, he instead looks over to his neighbour, Mr Benzene. Now this bromine is so hungry for electrons (Electronegative), he can break apart the aromatic ring and steal one of the electrons from one of the double bonds.</p>
                    
                    <p>So now we have a Benzene ring with a Bromine attached to one of the carbons, but now the ring's aromaticity is broken and it's very unhappy. To solve it's woes, the other compound present in this intermediate stage, FeBr<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup> is able to act as a Lewis Base, and steal one of the protons (Hydrogens) from the Benzene ring. In doing this, the Iron compound gives an electron to this Hydrogen (Which is paired to the other Bromine), which is able to replace the electron lost in the inital joining of the Bromine, and restabilises the molecule. Finally, we're left with our original FeBr<sub>3</sub>, a HBr<sup>+</sup> (Which essentially striped the Hydrogen off the Benzene), and a Brominated benzene ring.</p>
