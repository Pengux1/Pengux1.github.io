                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy!</h4>
                    
                    <p>We use NMR to figure out the number and type of atoms within a molecule and how these atoms are connected to each other. NMR uses a whole lot of physics junk to do with quantum spin and magnets, but I don't think we can be assessed on how it works, so I'm not covering it. Because of the magic that NMR uses, it's really only used two gather data on two elements, <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C.</p>
                    
                    <p>They don't really mention <sup>13</sup>C NMR at all, so for the sake of time, I'm just going to cover the <sup>1</sup>H NMR. In terms of analysis they should be pretty similar, just make sure you check if your spectrum is giving you data on the Carbons or Hydrogens in your molecule.</p>
                    
                    <p>To standardise reporting of NMR data, chemists have adopted a quantity called chemical shift (δ). This value is expressed as parts per million (ppm) and is derived from the difference between the known magnetic field of the spectrometer and a known standard set at 0 ppm (tetramethylsilane, TMS).</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text"><sup>1</sup>H NMR</h4>
                    
                    <p>Each signal in a spectrum relates to hydrogens in a specific chemical environment. A hydrogen atom will produce a signal that corresponds to the number of other adjacent hydrogens it can see. In general, the chemical shift of a hydrogen atom can only be influenced another hydrogen atom which is within three σ bonds away and which also sits in a different environment. If there are no hydrogens surrounding it at a distance of three bonds, the hydrogen atom will produce a single peak. If all the hydrogen atoms in a molecule are all chemically equivalent then a single peak will also be produced. For example, benzene gives only one signal in the 1H NMR spectrum because all the hydrogens are chemically equivalent.</p>

                            <p class="note">The NMR spectrum in the image is more accurate/better quality then the one I'm using as a reference. To make sure I don't get anything wrong, I'm using the peaks that are given, rather than actually interpreting that spectrum. The two are pretty similar, so you'll get the gist.</p>
                            
                            <p class="bold">NMR peaks of 7.45 ppm 1H doublet, 7.34 ppm 1H singlet, 7.25 ppm 1H soublet, 2.54 3H singlet are observed.</p>
                            
                            <p>This indicates that there are four unique hydrogen enviroments, 6 Hydrogens in total (Backing up the Molecular Formula), with one enviroment further away from the others.</p>
                            
                            <p>The 3H singlet at 2.54 ppm indicates an enviroment with three hydrogens with no neighbouring hydrogens. This means it is not on the aromatic ring, and we can assume it is likely a methyl group. As the other hydrogen enviroments are in close proximity to each other, we can assume they are on the Benzene ring which is further supported by their NMR shifts being in the same region as an aromatic hydrogen, as seen in the table.</p>
                            
                            <p>Finally making some quick assumptions, we can assume the two doublets are neighbouring hydrogen enviroments (As both are causing each other to split into two peaks), and the remaining hydrogen enviroment is somewhere on the ring where it can't influence these two hydrogen enviroments.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Microanalysis</h4>
                    
                    <p>Microanalysis is used to determine the <strong>Empirical Formula</strong> of an unknown compound. This is the first, and probably most important step of solving chemical structures, because if you get this wrong, your entire molecule will be wrong. Refer to the Microanalysis section further up for how to do this.</p>
                    
                    <p>The microanalysis determined that the <strong>Empirical Formula</strong> of the compound is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Mass Spectroscopy</h4>
                    
                    <div class="center">

                        <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/MSExample.png">

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>When you look at the graph, you're looking for the parent ion which is usually the highest peak (Be aware that some isotopes can play shinanigans and produce peaks at a higher m/z value than the parent ion). Get the m/z value for the highest peak, and you've got the (approximate) molar mass of your compound! Here we can see that the peak is around 188 - 189 m/z, and thus the molar mass of our compound is 188 - 189.</p>
                    
                    <p>We use this data to determine the <strong>Molecular Formula</strong> of our compound. To do this, you add up the molar mass of your <strong>Emperical Formula</strong>, which for our molecule is 189, and compare this with the parent ion from the Mass Spectra. If they're equal (Or close to it), then your Molecular Formula is the same as your Empirical Formula, and you can move on. For the scope of this course, if your molar mass is different to the parent ion, you divide or multiply your empirical formula until you get the sameish value.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Double Bond Equivalence</h4>
                    
                    <p>This is used to determine the number of double bonds and/or aromatic rings in the compound. Usually if this is equal to four or more, you have an aromatic ring (Just because they wouldn't give you a molecule with so many double bonds). Refer to the Double Bond Equivalence section above for how to do this.</p>
                    
                    <p>DBE = 8 - (1/2) * 8 + (1/2) * 0 + 1 = 5 Double Bond Equivalents.</p>
                    
                    <p>Therefore this molecule likely has a Benzene ring and one other double bond.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Infrared Spectroscopy</h4>

                    <p>IR Spectroscopy is used to determine the presence of functional groups in the compound. Again, for how to do this, see the IR Spectroscopy section above.</p>
                    
                    <p>This molecule has the following notable peaks: 3100 cm<sup>-1</sup> medium, sharp; 2600 cm<sup>-1</sup> medium, sharp; 1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> strong, sharp.</p>
                            
                    <p>So the 3100 cm<sup>-1</sup> indicates the molecule is aromatic, the 2600 cm<sup>-1</sup> indicates an alkane and the 1700 cm<sup>-1</sup> indicates a C=O stretch of some sort.</p>

                    <p>We use HNMR to determine the hydrogen enviroments in the molecule, the number of hydrogens in each enviroment, and the number of neighbouring hydrogen enviroments. Look at the HNMR section above for how to do this.</p>
                    
                    <p>NMR peaks of 7.45 ppm 1H doublet, 7.34 ppm 1H singlet, 7.25 ppm 1H soublet, 2.54 3H singlet are observed.</p>
                            
                    <p>This indicates that there are four unique hydrogen enviroments, 6 Hydrogens in total (Backing up the Molecular Formula), with one enviroment further away from the others.</p>

                    <p>The 3H singlet at 2.54 ppm indicates an enviroment with three hydrogens with no neighbouring hydrogens. This means it is not on the aromatic ring, and we can assume it is likely a methyl group.

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Determining the Chemical Structure</h4>
                    
                    <p>So what do we know? We know that the final structure should have 8 Carbons, 6 Hydrogens, 2 Chlorines and 1 Oxygen, thanks to the microanalysis/mass spectroscopy. We also know it should have 5 double bond equivalents, and that there will probably be a Benzene ring to satisfy 4 of them. We know that there will be an alkane enviroment somewhere, a C=O stretch somewhere and an aromatic ring from the IR Spectroscopy. And finally we know that there will be 4 Hydrogen enviroments, one with three Hydrogens (Likely a Methyl group) which has no neighbouring Hydrogens, two neighbouring each other with one hydrogen each on the Benzene ring, and one Hydrogen on the benzene ring, neighbouring no other hydrogens. Putting this all together we're left with:</p>
