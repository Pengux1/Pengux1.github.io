                            <p class="italics">"An instrument for measuring the polarization of light, and especially for determining the effect of a substance in rotating the plane of polarization of light."</p>
                            
                            <p>Imagine you're walking down the street, when suddenly you find an otherwise sterile beaker containing a mysterious white powder. As an upstanding citizen, you pick it up to dispose of it in the local chemical waste bucket, but just before you arrive a studious terrorist comes up to you and demands to know the optical activity of the powder you're currently holding. What do?</p>
                            
                            <p>In this scenario, you'd pull out your trusty polarimeter, a device used to measure the rotation of plane-polarised light. Once you make a solution of your powder with your flask of deionized water you keep on you, and put it in the machine, you're going to need to interpret the results.</p>
                            
                            <p>First you need to ask, what's happening? What even is plane-polarised light? This is actually quite tricky, and strays dangerously into physics territory, but basically, light travels as a wave osicilating randomly in all directions which is what we'd call unpolarised. Plane-polarised light however, only oscilates in a single plane perpendicular to the direction of ordinary light.</p>
                            
                            <p>When light passes through a solution containing a chiral molecule, the light is able to interact with the molecules electron cloud. When plane-polarised light passes through this, the direction of the light changes, and thus rotates the plane in which it is oscilating. <strong>Two enantiomers will rotate plane-polarised light by the same magnitude in opposite directions, while a racemic solution or achiral molecule will not rotate plane-polarised light.</strong> So by measuring the rotation of light that bounces off an enantiomer, we can determine the optical activity of a molecule.</p>
                            
                            <p>Now that we know what's happening, we need to interpret the results. When a beam of plane-polarised light is rotated counterclockwise the molecule is in the (0,L) form. When a beam of plane-polairsed light is rotated clockwise the molecule is of the (+, D) form. Make sure not to confuse this with the R/S notation, as they indicate the arrangement of groups at the stereogenic centre, while the polarimeter is indicating the optical activity. These two notations are independent of each other.</p>

                    <p>This one's pretty simple. A heck ton of molecules in nature exhibit chirality with a certain "handedness" (This probably wont be assessed, but most amino acids are 'left-handed', and most sugars are 'right-handed'), especially for receptors and enzymes in organisms. Because most medicine is basically throwing random chemicals at humans and hoping they positively interact with some receptor or enzyme in the body, chirality is pretty important, since a racemic mixture is basically two drugs in one solution.</p>
                    
                    <p>The famous, and likely assessed example of chirality causing problems in medicine is thalidomide, a drug introduced in 1957 to help pregnant women with morning sickness among other ailments. But dun dun dun, thalidomide had one chiral carbon, and the mixture sold was a racemic mixture of the R and S enantiomers. While the R enantiomer provided the theraputic benefit of the drug, the S enantiomer was much more sinister. As enantiomers react differently towards other chiral molecules (Such as proteins), the S enantiomer was teratogenic, and caused thousands of birth defects.</p>

The C-X bond in haloalkanes is polarized due to the electronegativity difference between the carbon and the halogen. This makes the carbon bearing the halogen partially positively polarized, hence able to attract an electron rich and/or negatively charged species.</p>
