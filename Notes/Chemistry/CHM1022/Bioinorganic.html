                    <p>Biology uses metal ions and ligands to form complexes that have a variety of biochemical properties. Rather terrifyingly, bioinorganic chemistry uses the principles of coordination chemistry to understand how biological pathways work, and how these metal ions and ligands may interact with biological function.</p>

                    <p>Unsurprisingly, these metal ions and ligands are essential for the functioning of the body (Thus they're called essential minerals). For example, your bones are made of calcium, your muscles and brain need sodium and potassium to work and magnesium is an important cofactor for many enzymic reactions. A table of important metals for biological function, and their mass in a typical 70kg male is shown below:</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Medical Applications</h4>
                    
                    <p>Metals can be used to combat a variety of diseases. The metal complexes are able to coordinate to biological molecules much the same way as regular small organic ligands.</p>
                    
                    <p>For some reason, we only get one example, so here it is! Cis-platin, a platinum anti-cancer agent is a well known example of a biological therapeutic metal complex. It is effective in the treatment of bladder, ovarian, cervical and testicular cancers, but has many negative side-effects such as nausea and kidney damage (not good).</p>
                    
                    <p>Cis-platin is a square-planar complex which is injected and travels through the bloodstream until it reaches cancerous cells. When in the cell, cis-platin exchanges its chloride ligands with water due to cells usually having low amounts of chlorine ions (Believe it or not), creating a charge complex. The reaction can be seen below.</p>
                    
                    <div class="center">

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The cis-platin then binds to DNA bases and prevents transcription of that strand. It then reacts with an adjacent guanine base and causes the DNA strand to unwind, further inhibiting replication. The two water ligands bind to adjacent guanine bases and not any other DNA bases. This can be seen below:</p>

                    <p>Amino acids and proteins are a major source of ligands in biological systems. If an amino acid contains an N, O or S atom (Which have lone pair electrons), they are able to form a bond with a metal.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Prosthetic Groups</h4>
                    
                    <p>Proteins are not always only made of amino acids, with some containing what is known as a prosthetic group. A prosthetic group is a non-protein (non-amino acid) group forming part of or combined with a protein, that is essential for the proteins functioning. A common example of a prosthetic group is a <strong>Haem Moiety</strong>, which is found in haemoglobin. If the prosthetic group contains a metal ion within the protein, it is called a <strong>metalloprotein</strong>.</p>

                    <p>Myoglobin (Mb) and Haemoglobin (Hb) are haem-iron proteins that transport oxygen around the body. Mb and each unit of Hb have a haem prosthetic group, which acts as the active site that binds O<sub>2</sub>. Hb transports oxygen in the blood of mammals, and Mb carries the oxygen to the muscles. The haem is connected to the protein via Histidine-Nitrogen coordinated to the Iron center, which leaves a vacent coordination site for Oxygen binding and transport.</p>
                    
                    <p>To simplify: There are two oxygen carriers we care about: Haemoglobin, which transports oxygen in the blood (It's also what makes blood red); and Myoglobin, which transports oxygen to the muscles. Both of these have a prosthetic group attached, called a haem, which contains an Fe molecule. This haem is connected to the larger protein via coordination between its iron center and the nitrogen in the protein. The iron center has a vacent coordination site, which allows it to bind and transport Oxygen.</p>
                    
                    <p>We're given this <i>q u a l i t y</i> image to depict the geometry of Myoglobin with and without oxygen attached:</p>

                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The Fe in deoxygenated myoglobin is high-spin Fe<sup>2+</sup> and it has a square pyramidal geometry. Upon oxygenation, the metal undergoes a redox change via an oxidation to Fe<sup>3+</sup> and changes its geometry to octahedral. This reaction is reversible, so the molecule will revert back to it's original geometry after releasing it's oxygen.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text red-text">Carbon Monoxide: The Silent Killer</h4>
                    
                    <p class="note">*Spooky music plays in background*</p>
                    
                    <p>You've probably heard of Carbon Monoxide (CO) from the news, a silent and deadly gas that could be killing you right now without you even knowing. What makes CO so deadly though? CO is able to bind to haem moieties <strong>200</strong>! times more strongly than oxygen, preventing the body from uptaking oxygen when present.</p>
                    
                    <p>Since both Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen binding is an equilibrium process, Carbon Monoxide poisoning can be reversed by breathing in high concentrations of oxygen.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Haemocyanin</h4>
                    
                    <p>You've done been fooled, Haemoglobin ain't the only oxygen carrier in town. While mammals use Haemoglobin with it's lame iron centered prosthetic group, the cool kids, Molluscs and Anthropods (Snails, crabs, scorpions, spiders, etc) use Haemocyanin for oxygen transport, with it's badass copper centered prosthetic group. Not only does it use a more radical metal, it also is blue as opposed to Haemoglobin's red, which quite frankly looks way more neat.</p>
                    
                    <p>The active site of the haemocyanin is made up of two copper centres in the +1 oxidation state, each which are coordinated to three histidine ligands. The example they give for a biological application is that the blood of the Horse-shoe crab is a potent antibacterial agent. Except this has nothing to do with haemocyanin, and the only relevance is that haemocyanin happens to be present.</p>

                    <p>Carbonic anhydrase is a commonly found zinc enzyme.
