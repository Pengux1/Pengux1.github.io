                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">The Carbonyl Group</h4>
                    
                    <p>Carbocylic acids, esters and amides all have one thing in common, they all contain a carbonyl group (R-C=O). A carboxylic acid has a hydrocarbon group and an alcohol about the carbonyl center (-OH). An ester is similar to this, however, the hydrogen of the acid is replaced by another alkyl group (-OR’). An amide consists of a carbonyl center bonded to a hydrocarbon group and an amine (-NH<sub>2</sub>, -NHR’ or -NR<sub>2</sub>). These molecules are all similar in structure, and thus have similar properties. They all have higher boiling points in comparison to alkanes of similar size.</p>
                    
                    <p>Carboxylic acids and their derivatives commonly undergo carbonyl-group substitution reactions, in which a group we represent as —Z replaces (substitutes for) the group bonded to the carbonyl carbon atom. The portion of the carboxylic acid that does not change during a carbonyl-group substitution reaction is known as an acyl group.</p>
                    
                    <div class="center">

                    </div>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Carbocylic Acids</h4>
                    
                    <p>Carbocylic acids are acidic (<span class="note">holy crap</span>), and readily ditch their hydrogen to form a carboxylate anion. This anion is stabilised by resonance leading to a markedly increased acidity. They are named by adding the -oic acid prefix.</p>
                    
                    <p>Carboxylic acids are typically weak acids, meaning they partially dissociate to form H+ ions and RCOO- anions. Carboxylic acids establish equilibria in aqueous solution with carboxylate anions (RCOO-). Carboxylate anions are named by replacing the -ic ending in the carboxylic acid name with -ate.</p>

                    <p>Carboxylic acids with 1 to 4 carbon atoms are miscible with water as the carbonyl is readily able to engage in hydrogen bonding with water. Solubility decreases with increasing carbon chain length because dipole forses become less predominant while dispersion forses become more predominant. Carboxylic acids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding between molecules (From the oxygen) and therefore exhibit high boiling points in comparison to compounds of comparable molar mass.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Esters</h4>
                    
                    <p>Esters are colourless and volatile liquids with pleasant fruity odors derived from carbocylic acids. The -OH group of the carboxylic acids is converted to an -OR in an ester. This loss of the hydrogen in the molecule also leads to a loss in possibility for molecules to form hydrogen bonds in esters. Therefore, boiling points are not as high as boiling points of carboxylic acids.</p>
                    
                    <p>Small esters are fairly soluble in water but the solubility decreases with increasing chain length. Their slight solubility is because esters can’t form hydrogen bonds with themselves, but they can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules.</p>
                    
                    <p>Esters are two words, the first being the alkyl group R of the ester group ending with a -yl, the second being the name of the parent acid with the family name ending -ic acid replaced by -ate.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Amides</h4>
                    
                    <p>Amides are compounds with a nitrogen directly attached to the carbonyl carbon atom. The nitrogen of an amide may be unsubstituted (-NH<sub>2</sub>), monosubstituted (-NRH) or disubstituted (-NR<sub>2</sub>). With the exception of formamide (HCONH<sub>2</sub>), which is a liquid, amides are solids (Figure 15). <strong>Importantly, amides are not basic like amines.</strong> The lack of basicity is due to the fact the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen of the amide are delocalised between the nitrogen and the oxygen through resonance.</p>
                    
                    <p>Unsubstituted amides can form multiple hydrogen bonds to other amide molecules resulting in generally high boiling points. Due to this hydrogen bonding, unsubtituted amides are also soluble in water. Monosubstituted amides are able to form hydrogen bonds with each other but disubstituted amides cannot leading to lower boiling points.</p>
                    
                    <p>Amides with an unsubstituted —NH<sub>2</sub> group are named by replacing the -ic acid or -oic acid of the corresponding carboxylic acid name with -amide. If the nitrogen atom has alkyl substituents on it, the compound is named by specifying the alkyl group and then identifying the amide name. The alkyl substituents are preceded by the letter N to identify them as being attached directly to nitrogen.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Acid Chlorides</h4>
                    
                    <p>There's not much about these, really only that acid chlorides are very reactive and will spontaneously react with alcohols and amines to esters and amides, respectively, even in absence of a catalyst. These reactions are typically very exothermic and fast.</p>

                    <p>The amide bond is synthesised when the carboxyl group reacts with an amine. The simplest amides are derived with ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), leading to RC(O)-NH<sub>2</sub> species. Amines can, however, also be mono- or disubstituted to yield substituted amides.</p>
                    
                    <p>Tertiary amines do not react with carboxylic acids to amides due to the lack of a N-H bond. Tertiary amines hence only react in acid-base reactions with organic acids.</p>

                    <p>Esters and amides can be hydrolysed to yield the parent carboxylic acid and alcohol/amine. The most well known hydrolysis reaction is saponofication, in which triglycerides (fats) are reacted with soldium hydroxide to yield fatty acids and glycerol.</p>
                    
                    <p>While esters can be hydrolyzed in acid or base catalyzed reactions, amides only undergo hydrolysis in acid catalyzed reactions.</p>

                    <p>Amides are considerable more stable than esters. While esters can be hydrolyzed in acid or base catalyzed reactions, amides only undergo hydrolysis in acid catalyzed reactions. This difference in reactivity stems from the fact that -NH<sub>2</sub> cannot be split of from the amide easily, while -NH<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> can leave the molecule and be replaced by an OH group.</p>
                    
                    <p>The reactivity of carboxylic acids and their derivatives depends on the basic strength of the acyl-bound substituent. -NH<sub>2</sub> groups are the most basic, followed by -OR and OH groups. Halogens are the weakest bases and are thus replaced most easily.</p>

                    <p>Luckily for the scope of this course, we only focus on two: Step-Growth and Radical Polymerisation.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Step-Growth Polymerisation</h4>
                    
                    <p>Step-Growth Polymerisation is when the monomers first form dimers and trimers before building up the larger polymer. Basically, two monomers react to form a dimer, which react to form a trimer when enough is present, and so on.</p>
                    
                    <p>This form of polymerisation is very conversion dependent, as longer chains cannot form unless most functional units have already been converted. Because of this, step-growth polymerisation takes a long time to work. Nylon is an example of a step-growth produced polymer, the reaction for which can be seen below:</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Radical Polymerisation</h4>
                    
                    <p>Radical Polymerisation is the other major pathway we need to care about.</p>
                    
                    <p>Typically, a radical initiator (which we will label I<sub>2</sub>) breaks down to form a reactive radical (I<sup>●</sup>). This in turn reacts with the monomer (M) to form a growing chain containing one monomer unit (R<sub>1</sub><sup>●</sup>). This reactive intermediate can then either a) propagate by finding another monomer unit (R<sub>i</sub><sup>●</sup> + M), b) transfer the radical functionality and become a 'dead' polymer (R<sub>i</sub>● + X) or c) react (terminate) with another growing chain to form product (R<sub>i</sub><sup>●</sup> + R<sub>j</sub><sup>●</sup>). This process is depicted below. Note that all these processes happen in parallel. The average lifetime of a growing chain from initiation to termination is typically around 1 second. </p>
                    
                    <p>This is very fast, as all the steps occur in parallel as opposed to step-growth.</p>

                    <p>When a polymer is first made, it is generally <strong>polydisperse</strong>, which means there are many different polymer units of varying lengths and sizes in the final product. Very few polymers are monodisperse wherein all of the individual chains are exactly the same length and size.</p>

                    <p>Because of this, we use polymer distributions where the molecular weight is used to represent the length of the chains being considered. The following graph shows the absolute molecular weight measured in a given polymer (x-axis) and a measure of how often that molecular weight was found (y-axis). You can see that this polymer has an average molecular weight around 1.3 x 105 g/mole – which is massive when compared to normal individual molecules.</p>

                    <p>The important piece of information to take here is that the two values are two different measurements of the same polymer. The M<sub>N</sub> value is a measure of the concentration of the chain lengths of the polymer whereas the M<sub>W</sub> value is a measure of its physical properties. The relationship between them is highly important and is known as polydispersity:</p>

                    <p>If the two values are the same (PDI = 1), the polymer is considered uniform with all chain lengths approximately the same length and size (Monodisperse). If there is a large amount of irregularity in the polymer the M<sub>W</sub> value will become larger than the M<sub>N</sub> value and result in a PDI > 1.</p>
