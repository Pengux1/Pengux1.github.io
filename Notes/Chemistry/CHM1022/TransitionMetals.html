                    <p>Transition metals are the elements from group 3 to group 6, also known as d-block elements. All transition elements are metals, they often form coloured compounds due to their electronic configuration, and can be paramagnetic (Attracted to a magnet). This magnetism is due to the presence of unpaired electrons. The colour of the metal is determined by their d-electrons and their oxidation state. For the purposes of this course, we will be focusing on the first-row transition metals.</p>
                    
                    <p>Transition metals have tons of uses, ranging from medicine, to industry, to even home decoration. If you need to list some, just think of literally any metal and what it's used for.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Periodic Trends in Ionisation Energy</h4>
                                        
                    <p><strong>Ionisation Energy is the energy required for the complete removal of 1 mol of electrons from 1 mol of atoms or ions in the gaseous state.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Atoms with a low Ionisation Energy tend to form cations during reactions, while Atoms with a high Ionisation Energytend to form anions (Excluding the nobel gases). The Ionisation Energy tends to correlate with the atomic size of the elements. For example, as the size of the atom decreases, the energy it takes to remove electrons increases. This is due to the smaller size of the atom contractinf the electrons closer to its positively charged nucleus, thus the electrostatic attraction requires more energy to overcome it.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="bold">It can be seen that IE generally decreases down a group, while increasing across the period.</span>  This however is only a general trend.  There are instances where this is not the case. In Figure 5, it can be seen that the first ionisation energy does not increase from Beryllium (Be) to boron (B) to Nitrogen (N) to Oxygen (O). This is due to the difference in the electronic configuration of these elements and the stability of half and fully-filled sub-shells.</p>
                    
                    <p>Ok, so this is a tad confusing but the reason the first ionisation energy does not always folow the general trend is as follows: Having a half or fully filled electronic configuration in any subshell is energetically favourable. Because of this if an element already has a half or fully filled subshell, the energy to remove one of these electrons will be higher. However if an element doesn't have one of these favourable electronic configurations, the energy required to lose an electron will not be substantial.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Periodic Trends in Electron Affinity</h4>

                    <p><strong>Electron Affinity can be described as the energy change accompanying the addition of 1 mol of electrons to 1 mol of atoms or ions in aa gaseous state.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p class="bold">Electron affinity increases upward for the groups and from left to right across periods of a periodic table because the electrons added to energy levels become closer to the nucleus, thus a stronger attraction between the nucleus and its electrons.</p>
                    
                    <p>The value of EA<sub>1</sub> is in most cases negative, while the value of EA<sub>2</sub> is always positive.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Periodic Trends in Electronegativity</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Electronegativity is a measure of an atoms tendency to attract a bond pair of electrons.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p><span class="bold">The electronegativity of transition metals increases across the row but then decrease down a group.</span> The change in electronegativity for the transition elements is relatively small across the transition series  It can also be noted that not all metals will follow the trend exactly, where metals such as Rhenium (Re) actually increase in electronegativity down the group.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Periodic Trends in Atomic Radius</h4>
                    
                    <p>Remember <strong>Shielding - the cancelling out of a portion of the attraction of the nucleus to the electron, due to the repulsion of these electrons to each other.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>For the d-block elements in particular we can see that filled inner d-orbitals shield the outer s-electrons from the increasing effective nuclear charge (Z<sub>eff</sub>, the net positive charge of the nucleus.) Therefore the atomic radii across the period of transition metals only decrease slightly.  The atomic radii of the d-block elements also decrease down each row.</p>
                    
                    <p class="bold">Atomic radius decreases from left to right within a period. This is caused by the increase in the number of protons and electrons across a period. One proton has a greater effect than one electron; thus, electrons are pulled towards the nucleus, resulting in a smaller radius.</p>

                    <p><strong>Atomic Orbitals</strong> are a partial description of the quantum state of an electron (or other particle) orbiting the nucleus of an atom. Different orbitals have different shapes and orientations, depending on the energy of the electron, its angular momentum, and its magnetic number. The most commonly filled orbitals are s, p, d, and f. Below are the different orbital shapes for various different quantum numbers.</p>

                    <p>d-orbitals are of particular relevance for the transition metals. They are five-fold <strong>degenerate</strong> (all equal energy) and like p-orbitals are directional. However unlike p-orbitals they have two nodal planes (where the probability of finding an electron is zero) and the sign change does not occur through the centre (a sign change for example is when the two p atomic orbitals are in phase with each other but the two lobes have opposite signs). The five equivalent d-orbitals can be seen below.</p>

                            <p>The aufbau principle states that in the ground state of an atom or ion, electrons fill atomic orbitals of the lowest available energy levels before occupying higher levels. For example, the 1s shell is filled before the 2s subshell is occupied.</p>

                            <p>The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two electrons in an atom can be defined by the same four quantum numbers n, I, ml, and ms. What this tells us is that every electrons in an atom is uniquely defined by its set of four quantum numbers. The spins of those electrons in each orbital therefore cannot be the same.</p>

                    <p>You should really know how to do the basics of electronic configurations by now, some I'm just including some possible gotchya's they might include.</p>
                    
                    <p>When applying this principle to the electronic configuration of the transition metal series it can be observed that the 4s orbital is filled before the 3d. This is due the sum of the 4s orbital being smaller than the 3d (4 and 5 respectively). </p>
                    
                    <p>When forming ions in transition metal complexes, though the 4s sub-shell is filled first in the orbital diagram, <strong>the s-orbital is the first to lose electrons</strong>, due to its proximity as the outer-most sub-shell. For example, the electronic configuration of a Ti2+ ion will be [Ar] 3d2 and not [Ar] 4s2. It can be noted that different metals with the same electronic configuration (due to differing oxidation states) will in most cases have similar properties, for example, both manganese +II (Mn2+) and iron +III (Fe3+) with an outer-shell configuration of 3d5 produce pale colours.</p>

                   <h4 class="page-header flow-text">The Principal Quantum Number (n)</h4>
                        
                    <p>The principal quantum number,  n , designates the principal electron shell. Because n describes the most probable distance of the electrons from the nucleus, the larger the number n is, the farther the electron is from the nucleus, the larger the size of the orbital, and the larger the atom is. n can be any positive integer starting at 1, as  n=1  designates the first principal shell (the innermost shell). The first principal shell is also called the ground state, or lowest energy state. </p>
                    
                    <p> All orbitals that have the same n value are in the same principal level. For example, all orbitals on the second principal level have a principal quantum number of n=2. When the value of n is higher, the number of principal electronic shells is greater. This causes a greater distance between the farthest electron and the nucleus. As a result, the size of the atom and its atomic radius increases.</p>
                    
                    <p>Because the atomic radius increases, the electrons are farther from the nucleus. Thus it is easier for the atom to expel an electron because the nucleus does not have as strong a pull on it, and the ionization energy decreases.</p>
                    
                    <p>The value of n is equal to the number of subshells in a principal electronic shell.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">The Orbital Angular Momentum Quantum Number (l)</h4>

                    <p>The orbital angular momentum quantum number l determines the shape of an orbital, and therefore the angular distribution. The number of angular nodes is equal to the value of the angular momentum quantum number l. Each value of l indicates a specific s, p, d, f subshell (each unique in shape.) The value of l is dependent on the principal quantum number n. Unlike n, the value of l can be zero. It can also be a positive integer, but it cannot be larger than one less than the principal quantum number (n-1).</p>
                    
                    <p>The s subshell has an l value of 0, the p subshell has an l value of 1, the d subshell has an l value of 2 and the f subshell has an l value of 3.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">The Magnetic Quantum Number (m<sub>l</sub>)</h4>

                    <p>The magnetic quantum number  ml  determines the number of orbitals and their orientation within a subshell. Consequently, its value depends on the orbital angular momentum quantum number  l . Given a certain  l ,  ml  is an interval ranging from  –l  to  +l , so it can be zero, a negative integer, or a positive integer.</p>
                    
                    <p>The number of orbitals in a subshell is equivalent to the number of values the magnetic quantum number ml takes on. A helpful equation to determine the number of orbitals in a subshell is 2l +1. This equation will not give you the value of ml, but the number of possible values that ml can take on in a particular orbital. For example, if l=1 and ml can have values -1, 0, or +1, the value of 2l+1 will be three and there will be three different orbitals.</p>
                    
                    <p>The shape and orientation of an orbital depends on l and ml.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">The Electron Spin Quantum Number (m<sub>s</sub>)</h4>

                    <p>Unlike  n ,  l , and  ml , the electron spin quantum number  ms  does not depend on another quantum number. It designates the direction of the electron spin and may have a spin of +1/2, represented by↑, or –1/2, represented by ↓. This means that when  ms  is positive the electron has an upward spin, which can be referred to as "spin up." When it is negative, the electron has a downward spin, so it is "spin down." The significance of the electron spin quantum number is its determination of an atom's ability to generate a magnetic field or not.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Oxidation and Reduction</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Oxidation is the LOSS of electrons, and Reduction is the GAIN of electrons!</strong> Remember OIL RIG - Oxidation is Loss, Reduction is Gain.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>An oxidant is a substance that causes another to be oxidised, that undergoes reduction itself. A reductant is a substance that causes another to be reduced, that undergoes oxidation itself.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Redox reaction requires both OXIDATION and REDUCTION, electrons from the oxidation reaction are used for the reduction reaction.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Oxidation Numbers</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>An oxidation number is the hypothetical charge that an individual atom/ion in a molecule would possess if the shared electrons in a covalent bond were assigned to most electronegative element in the bond.</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>An increase in oxidation number indicates that electrons were lost and oxidation occured. A decrease in oxidation number indicates that electrons were gained and reduction occured.</p>

                    <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Oxidation States of Transition Metals</h4>
                    
                    <p>Multiple oxidation states are a common feature of the transition metal series.  As with most other metals, transition metals will prefer to lose electrons and form positively charged ions. However, in some instances a transitional metal could have a negative oxidation state.</p>
                    
                    <p>The oxidation state of +2 is very common for transition elements because ns<sup>2</sup> electrons are more easily lost than those in the inner sub-shells. The formation of +3 oxidation states is also very common but other oxidation states are also readily accessible with manganese having the highest stable state of +7.  Higher oxidation states (e.g. +8, etc.) are very uncommon due to the increased ionisation energy. It should be also noted that Zn has really only one accessible oxidation state +2 which is primarily due to Zn2+ having a d10 electronic configuration i.e. a fully-filled d sub-shell. </p>
                    
                    <p>One of the most significant differences therefore between the d-block elements and those from the s and p-block is this wide range of stable oxidation states. Most often elements from the s-block will only have one accessible stable oxidation state, and those form the p-block one or two. Elements from the d-block have a wide range of accessible and stable oxidation states that often dictate a wide variety of chemical properties and chemical reactivity.</p>
