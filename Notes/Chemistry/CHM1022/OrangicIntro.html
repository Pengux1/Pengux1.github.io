                <p>Alkanes are made entirely of sp<sup>3</sup> hybridised carbons, with the simplest member being methane. Due to this hybridisation a methane molecule has a tetrahedral geometry with all C-H bonds at 109.5 degrees from each other.</p>
            
                <p>While methane, the simplest hydrocarbon can only have one shape, alkanes with two or more carbons can have various three dimensional structures called conformations. They result not by chainging the bond angles (Which are all fixed at 109.5°, but by rotating around sigma-bonds.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Staggered Conformation</strong> is where the roation of the sigma-bond creates the longest distance between the atoms attached to each carbon.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Eclipsed Conformation</strong> is when the atoms on each carbon are as close as possible to each other.</p>
                
                <p>As we increase the number of carbon & hydrogen atoms on the hydrocarbon molecule, the properties of the molecule changes, with melting point, boiling point and density all increasing. This is a result of increased intermolecular horses between the molecules.</p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Cycloalkanes</h4>
                
                <p class="note">I legitimately did not realise these were different things to benznes.</p>
                
                <p>Alkanes in a ring like structure are called cycloalkanes. Conformationaly they are less flexible than non ring-like compounds. While hexane has 1000's of different possible conformations, cyclohexane is limited to two. <strong>These two confromations allow all C-H bonds to be positioned farthest from each other, and C-C bonds to be at 109.5°.</strong>. To name cyclic structures, attach the prefix cyclo-.</p>
                
                <p>One structure is called the chair structure. There is another structure that is less stable, but can also be observed, this is called the twist boat structure.</p>
                
                <p>The energy diagram below represents how cyclohexane converts between these conformations. Underneath the energy diagram is a figure which uses the terms axial and equatorial. An <strong>axial</strong> bond is one that makes a large angle with the average plane of the ring, whereas <strong>equatorial</strong> bond is one that makes a small angle.</p>

                <p>Most molecules have bonds on the x-, y- and z-axes, which we need to represent on paper somehow. How do?</p>
                
                <p>For the purposes of this course, we use <strong>Dashed and Wedged Bonds</strong> to represent 3D structure. With this convention, regular lines represent bonds on the 2D plane, Dashed bonds are pointing away from you, and Wedged bonds are pointing towards you.</p>
            
                <p>So if the line is a completely solid <strong>wedge</strong>, then since wedges are delicious, it's coming towards you. If the line is a not solid series of <strong>dashes</strong>, then much like how Dashing people run away from you, those bonds are going away from you.</p>

                <p>So the best that I can make out from the given material is that since alkanes can rotate along their sigma bonds, they do so. In comparison, alkenes have pi- bonds as well as sigma bonds due to them having one or more double bonds, which also makes the sigma bonds only able to be in certain conformations (in the same plane, different to the pi bonds) to avoid overlap with these pi- bonds. Pi- bonds take a significant amount of energy to break (~264 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>), and rotation from the blane along the sigma-bond results in breaking the pi-bond. Thus this does not occur.</p>

                <p class="note">Oh god what even are these?</p>
                
                <p>A Newman projection, useful in alkane stereochemistry, visualizes the conformation of a chemical bond from front to back, with the front atom represented by a dot and the back carbon as a circle. The front carbon atom is called proximal, while the back atom is called distal. The steps to make them are as follows (And directly stolen from <a href="http://www.chem.ucla.edu/~harding/notes/acyclic_01.pdf">here</a>.</p>
                
                <ul class="collection">
                
                    <li class="collection-item">1. First, you will need a molecule with a small chain of carbons such as this one:<br><div class="center"><img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/NewmanStep1.png"></div></li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item">2. Then, you will need to line up two of the center carbons. For this case, we will line up the 2 and 3 carbon as labeled on the above image. The 2 carbon will be in front, and the 3 carbon will be in the back.</li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item">3. Draw the front carbon first and all its attachments. The angles between each attachment should be about 120 degrees.<br><div class="center"><img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/NewmanStep2.png"></div></li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item">4. Then draw in the back carbon and all its attachments. To do this, first draw a circle to indicate the back carbon, and then add the back carbon’s attachments as branches to the circle.<br><div class="center"><img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/NewmanStep3.png"></div></li>

                </ul>
                
                <p>There are two Newman Projections that are of primary concern. The one you drew above is the staggered conformation for the molecule. The other projection that is of primary concern is the eclipsed structure (As mentioned earlier).</p>
                
                <div class="center">
                
                    <img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/NewmanTypes.png">
                    
                </div>
                
                <p>The staggered structure is more stable as it more evenly spaces out its attachments, reducing repulsion between the front carbon's attachments and the back carbon's attachments. The eclipsed structure is less stable (And less favourable) because it forces more interactions between the front and back attachments, creating more strain.</p>

                        <p>The chair conformation is the lowest energy conformation and the most common. In this, there are two planes with carbon atoms alternating the plane that they are in, making carbon atoms 1, 3 and 5 in one plane and carbon atoms 2, 4 and 6 in another plane (Starting with the top right corner being carbon 1). There are two possible positions for hydrogen atoms (or other substituents) to be located: axial and equatorial. The axial position is not parallel to any of the carbon-carbon bonds while the equatorial position is parallel to one or more of the carbon-carbon bonds.</p> 
                        
                        <p>The carbon atoms 1, 3 and 5 have the axial positions pointing up while equatorial is pointing down; while carbon atoms 2, 4 and 6 have the axial position as the carbon pointing down, while the equatorial pointing up. This creates very little strain between the molecules, due to the alternating bonds, making it the most stable.</p>

                        <p>The boat conformation has the highest energy of all three conformations. In the boat conformation carbon atoms 2, 3, 5, and 6 are in the same plane with carbon atoms 1 and 4 in another plane. The boat conformation is very high energy due to several factors, includign the flagpole effect, where the two equatorial bonds of carbon 1 and carbon 4 end up pointing towards each other, making them very close and interfering with each other causing steric tension.</p>

                <p>As pi-bonds cannot rotate, this allows alkenes to have isomers called <strong>diastereoisomers</strong>. As opposed to constitutional isomers, in which the conectivity of the atoms is different (and which alkanes can have as well), diastereoisomers have the same connectivity but different orientation in space. To figure out if two molecules are diastereoisomers, follow the checklist below:</p>

                <p>As for naming, if the higher priority groups (Greater the atomic number, greater the priority) are on the same side, we call the molecule cis. If they are are on opposite sites, we call the molecule trans.</p>

                <p>Breaking an alkane C-C sigma-bond requires 348 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. An alkene is 612 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>, because two bonds are broken, the sigma-bond worth 348 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup> and the pi-bond worth 264 kJ mol<sup>-1</sup>. Reactions of alkenes that we will discuss don’t break both bonds but rather break the weakest bond, the pi-bond to give new products.</p>
                
                <p>Define - <strong>Carbocation - A chemical species which contains a positively charged carbon atom with only three bonds to it.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Alkenes have two pairs of electrons (Found in the sigma bond and the pi bond) between two carbon atoms, and so we consider them to be electron rich. As they are electron rich they are attracted to positive charges, such as nuclei, so we call them <strong>nucleophiles</strong>. Nucleophiles react with things that like electrons, called <strong>Electrophiles</strong>.</p>

                <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Energetics of Reaction</h4>
                
                <p>Breaking bonds costs energy, while making releases energy. So looking at the reaction we can see that in the first step, the pi-bond in the alkene is broken, the sigma-bond in the HBr is broken, and an ionic interaction formed. In the second step no bonds are broken, buy a sigma-bond is gained. Knowing that breaking bonds costs energy, and the first step of the reaction breaks two of them and only forms one (as opposed to the second reaction which breaks two), we would expect the activaiton energy of the first step is larger than the second.  As a consequence the step that defines the overall rate of this reaction (as in the slower of the two steps), known as the rate determining step, is the first step. The energy diagram below describes this, and also shows that the reaction is exothermic (-ΔH).</p>
                
                <div class="center">

                <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Markovnikov's Rule</h4>
                
                <p>While the reaction described above only produced a single product, this is not always the case. If a non-symmetrical alkene is reacted with HBr, there are two prodcuts that can be produced. These are constitutional isomers with the position of the hydrogen and bromine switched. So the question is, which one will form? Well basically, if you look at the energy diagram for the reaction, the pathway that forms a more stable carbocation will form more quickly, and thus be the major product. Our boy Markovnikov proposed the following rule for non-symmetrical alkene addition reactions with H-X (Where X is an electronegative element).</p>
                
                <p class="bold">"The alkene carbon that has the most hydrogens begins to gain more."</p>
                
                <p>So following this rule, the hydrogen from HBr will bond with the alkene carbon with the larger number of hydrogens.</p>
                
                <p><strong>AHHH Side-note: the prefix "regio-" indicates a preference of one over another.  Therefore a "regioisomer" is an isomer which its structure is preferential over other isomers.  "Regioselective" is where one direction of bond breaking or bond forming occurs in preference to all others.</strong></p>
                
                <h4 class="page-header flow-text">Carbocation Stability</h4>
                
                <p>While we could use Markovnikov's nice and easy rule to predict the outcome of a non-symmetrical alkene, you could also arrive at the same conclusion by considering the stability of the carbocations involved if you really wanted to.<strong> At a fundemental level, the more charge can be spread out, the more stable the cation will be.</strong></p>
                
                <p>Two main factors determine how spread out the charge is:</p>
                
                <ul class="collection center">
                    
                    <li class="collection-item grey lighten-2 bold">Inductive Effects</li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item">A positively charged atom attracts electrons from adjacent sigma-bonds. As such the charge is spread between these atoms. So the more sigma-bonds, the more stabilised the carbocation is. Hence, the following order of carbocation stability arises.</li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item "><img class="responsive-img" src="/img/Notes/Chemistry/CHM1022/InductiveEffects.png"></li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item grey lighten-2 bold">Resonance Effects</li>
                    
                    <li class="collection-item">If the adjacent atoms has a pi-bond, then electrons can be redistributed to spread out the positive charge. This is described below. Note the two resonance structures are identical except for a redistribution of electrons. As such a special “resonance” arrow connects the two structures.</li>
