                    <h4 class="flow-text page-header">The Discovery of Viruses</h4>
                    
                    <p class="note">The dates are going to have to be a little fuzzy here, the slides and Wikipedia have different times for all these discoveries.</p>
                    
                    <p>Flash back to 1884, by then we know all about Bacteria and their nefarious ways, yet the cause of some diseases such as rabies still eludes scientists. This french microbiologist, Charles Chamberland invents a filter, known today as a Chamberland Filter, which has pores smaller than bacteria. Using this scientists can now remove the bacteria from a solution.</p>
                    
                    <p>In 1892, Russian biologist Dmitry Ivanovsky uses this new fangled filter to study what is now known as the tobacco mosiac virus. At this point, scientists belive that this disease is caused by eitehr a toxin or a very small bacterium, but they do know it's infectious. Using the Chamberland Filter, Ivanosky shows that crushed leaf extracts from infected plants remain infectious after filtration, and suggests that this might be caused by some toxin produced by bacteria. However instead of testing this, he kinda gets bored and moves on to other things.</p>
                    
                    <p>Finally in 1898, a Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck repeats these experiments and becomes convinced that the filtrate contains a new form of infectious agent. He observed that the agent only multiplied in cells that were diving, and even introduced the word virus to describe them. However he thought that viruses were strictly water soluble, which was later proven not to be the case.</p>
                    
                    <p>It doesn't look like we have to go any deeper than this, but basically when we go back to the Tobaaco Mosaic Virus, scientists saw that something was causing these tobacco plants to get sick. This infectious agent remained after filtering out the bacteria from a solution and couldn't be cultured on lab media, nor could it be seen under a light microscope. Using logic and a small element of pure guessing, scientists figured out it was an agent that was infecting the leaf, which was later confirmed using an electron microscope.</p>
                    
                    <h4 class="flow-text page-header">What are Viruses?</h4>
                    
                    <p>Viruses are a class of acellular infectious agents that are characterised by lacking complete enzyme systems, replicating inside host cells using host cell factors and by having a limitied host range. The technical term used to describe viruses is that they are <strong>obligate intracellular parasites</strong>. </p>

                    <p>All viruses contain the following two components: <strong>A nucleic acid genome</strong> and <strong>a Capsid</strong> made of repeating protein subunits (Called Capsomeres or Coat Proteins) that covers the genome. Together this is called the <strong>nucleocapsid</strong>. In addition, many animal viruses contain a <strong>Outer Lipid Envelope</strong>. The entire intact virus is called the <strong>virion</strong>. Viral glycoproteins are embedded in the envelope. </p>

                        <p class='flow-text'>One of the two cycles of viral reproduction (referring to bacterial viruses or bacteriophages), the other being the lysogenic cycle. The lytic cycle results in the destruction of the infected cell and its membrane.</p>

                        <p class='flow-text'>The lysogenic cycle is a method by which a virus can replicate its DNA using a host cell. Typically, viruses can undergo two types of DNA replication: the lysogenic cycle or the lytic cycle. In the lysogenic cycle, the DNA is only replicated, not translated into proteins.</p>

                        <p class='flow-text'>An infectious protein particle similar to a virus but lacking nucleic acid; thought to be the agent responsible for scrapie and other degenerative diseases of the nervous system. Basically a misfolded protein.</p>

                        <p class='flow-text'>Viral envelopes are typically derived from portions of the host cell membranes (phospholipids and proteins), but include some viral glycoproteins. They may help viruses avoid the host immune system. Glycoproteins on the surface of the envelope serve to identify and bind to receptor sites on the host's membrane.</p>

                        <p class='flow-text'>An entire virus particle consisting of an outer protein shell called a capsid and an inner core of nucleic acid (either ribonucleic or deoxyribonucleic acid—RNA or DNA). The core confers infectivity, and the capsid provides specificity to the virus.</p>
